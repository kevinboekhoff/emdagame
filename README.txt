Game Framework Principle
This folder contains the skeleton framework of the Team A's JavaScript based Game. The framework is set up using HTML and combined with CSS and JavaScript. The Framework aims to meet all modern day web standards. This includes major emphasis on Search Engine Optimization (SEO) requirements and guidelines to boost the overall SEO rating. The framework of the game also targets mobile users, and has been incorporated with a responsive framework that will scale all content between mobile phones/tablets, to desktops and projectors. The last scope of the framework focuses on accessibility of the games content. This relates more to the visual components of the game and allowing users to control how the these components are displayed on their screen.

These principles aim to promote our game on the web, but primarily emphasis on creating a more intuitive and personalized experience for users.
